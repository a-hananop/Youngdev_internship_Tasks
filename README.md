## Task 1 – Basic Python Programs  
**Objective:** Build a strong foundation in Python programming by solving beginner-friendly problems.

### Key Features:  
- Practice with loops and conditionals  
- Work with string manipulation and numeric computations  
- Implement simple mathematical algorithms  
- Learn user input handling and basic functions  

### Programs Included:  
- Fibonacci sequence generator  
- Prime number checker  
- String reversal  
- Basic calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)  
- Factorial calculation

## Task 2 – Intermediate Python Tasks  
**Objective:** Advance your Python skills by working with data structures, modular design, file operations, and OOP.

### Key Features:  
- Use lists and dictionaries for data processing  
- Write reusable functions and modules  
- Perform file input/output operations for data persistence  
- Understand classes and objects to model real-world entities  

### Sample Tasks:  
- Word frequency counter using dictionaries  
- Simple math library with functions and modules  
- Reading and writing student records using file handling  
- Creating and using classes like Student or Bank Account

## Task 3 – Mini Python Project  
**Objective:** Integrate your knowledge by creating a practical application that simulates a real-world scenario.

### Key Features:  
- Design interactive user interfaces with console input/output  
- Manage program flow using control structures  
- Implement scoring and feedback systems  
- Combine multiple concepts: functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures  

### Project Example:
